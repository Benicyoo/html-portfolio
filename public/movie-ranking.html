<h1>Best Movies According to Benicio</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time in order</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>DUNE</h3>
<p>Absolutely phenominal movie. Beautiful visuals, cinematography, amazing and in depth
    characters and of course the amazing music by Hans Zimmer and his team.
</p>
<h3>DUNE part 2</h3>
<p>Every good thing carried over only second because in the first movie
    and start of this one I fully believed, like stilgar that Paul was the 
    Lisan Al-Gaib but he quickly became power hungry and aggressive after
    drinking the worm blood and I felt like I realized myself being indoctrinated
    into a cult.
</p>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>I got emotional ties to that movie RIP Stoic the Vast</p>
